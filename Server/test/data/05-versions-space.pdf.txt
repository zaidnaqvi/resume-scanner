Projects :
CSS Framework :
To learn SASS (SCSS), I have created 
a CSS framework like Bootstrap. This 
framework includes utility classes for 
margin, padding, gap, etc., and 
components like cards and buttons.
I used Live Sass Compiler VS code 
extension to compile Sass code into 
css.
I learned Scss syntax and how to use 
it efficiently.
I also learned about variables, 
objects, function, loops and more.
Advice Generator App :  
I have created advice generator 
app, inspired by a project on 
frontendmentor.io
This fetches random advice from the 
Advice Slip API and shows it when 
interacting with a button using Fetch 
API.
Had some extra functionality to copy 
the fetched advice along with its ID 
for user
